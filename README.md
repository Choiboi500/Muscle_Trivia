# "Anatomy: The Game"
"Anatomy Trivia: The Game" is an informative game for players who want to improve their knowledge of different systems of the body. A play can open my game and quiz their own knowledge of the human anatomy with a random draw of trivia questions. Itâ€™ll keep score so the player can try to improve on their score, and ultimately their knowledge of the human anatomy as well. Should be great for Biology students.

## Current Features
- Players can choose different systems of body.

- Players can see their end-score to improve on over time.
