# "Anatomy: The Game"
"Anatomy Trivia: The Game" is an informative game for players who want to improve their knowledge of different systems of the body. A play can open my game and quiz their own knowledge of the human anatomy with a random draw of trivia questions. It’ll keep score so the player can try to improve on their score, and ultimately their knowledge of the human anatomy as well. Should be great for Biology students.

## Current Features
- Players can choose different systems of body.
- Players will get a random selection of questions so that the quiz is never the same.
- Players can answer questions in any case-lettering.
- Players can see their end-score to improve on over time.
