## Project Description

My game is called Muscles Trivia: The Game. It's an informative game for players who want to improve their knowledge of muscles and maybe other systems. A user can open my game and quiz their own knowledge of the human anatomy with a random draw of trivia questions. It’ll keep score so the player can try to improve on their score, and ultimately their knowledge of the human anatomy as well.
